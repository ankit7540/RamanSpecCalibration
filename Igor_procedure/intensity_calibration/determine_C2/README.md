# Intensity  calibration

Refer to **concept** and **Exmaples** for simple procedure explaining  the code  for  obtaining  the wavelength dependent sensitivity.

**Model_rotationalRaman_spectra** includes procedure  for  obtaining theoretical pure  rotational  Raman  spectra of H<sub>2</sub>, HD, D<sub>2</sub>.  The intensity  ratios  required for the fitting  can  be  obtained from  ratio  of intensities from  these calculated  spectra.

**Obtaining_wavelength_sensitivity**  includes  the  procedure  for  performing the fit using  data from experimental  band intensity  ratios and the corresponding theoretical  ratio.
